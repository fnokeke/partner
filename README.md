Goal: Check the influence of Study Language Style Matching (LSM) on people. For
instance, check LSM amongst strangers and find out how this changes as these
strangers spend more time with each other.

There are two types of input files: Moves data (json format) and LSM data from
gmail (csv format).

Moves data is used to obtain users' location data together with their activities.
While LSM data is gmail data that gives the frequency of functional words when
one user is compared to another.
